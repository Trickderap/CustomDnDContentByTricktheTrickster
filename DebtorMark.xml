            <p>This mark is the receipt of a suspicious revival offer accepted in a moment of desperation. It manifests on the back of your hand as a circle of <strong>20 iron chain links</strong> surrounding a <strong>sun with 8 rays</strong>.</p>
            <p>The mark acts as a precise metabolic countdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Active Phase (Hours 1-8):</strong> Upon waking, the 8 solar rays glow with unnatural heat, granting you heightened reflexes (+2 AC). <strong>Every hour, one ray extinguishes and one corresponding chain link fades.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The Burden Phase (Hours 9-20):</strong> After 8 hours, the sun is dark and the first 8 links are gone. The remaining 12 iron links continue to bind your vitality. These fade one by one, hour by hour. Only when the 20th link vanishes are you physically capable of benefiting from a Long Rest again.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Bargain:</strong> For 8 hours after you finish a long rest, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class. However, you cannot benefit from another long rest until at least 20 hours have passed since the end of your last one.</p>

            <description>For 8 hours after a long rest, you gain a +2 bonus to AC (8 rays). After this, you cannot long rest again until 20 hours have passed (20 links).</description>
