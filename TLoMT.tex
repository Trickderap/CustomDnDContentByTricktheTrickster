\section*{Brand of the Dead Man's Wager}
\textit{Dark Gift (Supernatural Gift)}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent \textbf{Prerequisite:} Wisdom 10 or higher

\noindent This brand is a ``Dead Man's Marker''---a gambling debt signed by a soul that should have departed. It manifests on the back of your hand as a circle of \textbf{20 iron chain links} surrounding a \textbf{sun with 8 rays}.

The mark represents a high-stakes wager: you have been granted a loan on your life, but the terms are volatile. By accepting this revival, you have handed the Dealer a blank check---an unspecified favor to be called in at their discretion.

\subsection*{The Metabolic Clock}
The brand acts as a precise countdown tied to your vitality. It cycles through two phases each day:

\subsubsection*{1. The Active Phase (Hours 1--8)}
Upon finishing a Long Rest, the 8 solar rays of the mark ignite with unnatural heat.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benefit:} You gain a \textbf{+2 bonus to Armor Class}.
    \item \textbf{Visual:} One ray extinguishes every hour. Once the last ray fades (after 8 hours), the protection ends.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{2. The Burden Phase (Hours 9--20)}
Once the sun is dark, the weight of the debt settles.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Restriction:} You lose the AC bonus and cannot benefit from a Long Rest until the 20th hour has passed.
    \item \textbf{Visual:} The chain links begin to fade one by one, counting down the hours until you are permitted to rest again.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Rolling the Bones}
The debt is unstable. During the \textbf{Burden Phase} (from the 9th hour onward), the odds turn against you.

For every hour that passes during the Burden Phase, roll a \textbf{d20}. If you roll a \textbf{1}, the Dealer collects interest on the debt. Roll a \textbf{d8} on the Corruption Table below to determine the penalty.

\hline
\textbf{d8} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
1 & \textbf{Singed Nerves} & The chains heat up violently. You take \textbf{1d4 fire damage} which cannot be reduced in any way. \\
\hline
2 & \textbf{Phantom Weight} & The mark feels impossibly heavy, dragging your arm down. Your \textbf{walking speed is reduced by 10 feet} for 1 hour. \\
\hline
3 & \textbf{Creaking Joints} & Your movements echo with the sound of grinding metal. You have \textbf{Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth)} checks for 1 hour. \\
\hline
4 & \textbf{Spectral Whispers} & You hear the murmurs of debt collectors in the periphery. You have \textbf{Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)} checks for 1 hour. \\
\hline
5 & \textbf{Lead Arm} & Your muscles seize up under the weight of the debt. You have \textbf{Disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws} for 1 hour. \\
\hline
6 & \textbf{Metabolic Tax} & The mark siphons your vitality to pay the interest. Your \textbf{Hit Point Maximum is reduced by 1d6 + your level} until you finish a Long Rest. \\
\hline
7 & \textbf{Feverish Haze} & The pain clouds your mind. You have \textbf{Disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks} for 1 hour. \\
\hline
8 & \textbf{Grace Period} & A loophole opens, or perhaps the Dealer is feeling generous. The chains fade early and the cooldown ends immediately. \textbf{You may begin a Long Rest at any time.} \\
\hline

\subsubsection*{Dungeon Master Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Dealer's Favor:} The ``Unspecified Favor'' is a narrative hook. The DM can invoke this at any time, forcing the player to undertake a specific quest, spare a specific enemy, or sacrifice a valuable item to settle the ``principal'' of the debt.
    \item \textbf{Removal:} As a supernatural mark, this cannot be removed by \textit{Dispel Magic}. It requires a \textit{Wish} spell, divine intervention, or the completion of the Dealer's Favor.
\end{itemize}
