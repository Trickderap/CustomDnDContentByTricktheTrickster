### Items / Feats

#### Brand of the Dead Man's Wager
*   **Concept:** A gambling debt signed by a soul that should have departed. A "Dark Gift" that acts as a metabolic clock.
*   **Mechanic - The Metabolic Clock:**
    *   **Active Phase (Hours 1-8):** You gain **+2 AC**. The mark glows, counting down the hours.
    *   **Burden Phase (Hours 9-20):** The mark goes dark. You lose the AC bonus and cannot benefit from a Long Rest until the 20th hour has passed.
*   **Rolling the Bones:** During the Burden Phase, there is a risk of corruption or penalty if luck turns against you.
*   **Prerequisite:** Wisdom 10 or higher.
*   **Note:** This content is added as an Item that grants a Feat. Equip the item "Brand of the Dead Man's Wager" to activate the effects.
