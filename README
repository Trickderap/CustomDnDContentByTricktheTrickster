## 📦 What's Inside?

### 🧬 Lineages
* **Chanceborn:** Born from a convergence of improbable events, these "living talismans" manipulate probability and treat natural 1s as mere suggestions.

### 🛡️ Subclasses
* **Cleric: Chance Domain** - Reject destiny and embrace the chaos of the moment with exploding dice and probability manipulation.
* **Paladin: Oath of the Ledger** - The cosmic debt collectors. You are the enforcer who ensures everyone pays up, tracking down oathbreakers and tax evaders of the soul.
* **Paladin: Oath of the Debtor** - Sworn by the desperate. You are living collateral, utilizing your cursed debt and temporary health to survive another day.
* **Rogue: The Cardsharp** - Blend arcane infusion with sleight of hand. Treat playing cards as lethal weapons and unleash a 52-card pickup of doom.
* **Warlock: The Proprietor** - Sign a contract of employment with the ultimate cosmic casino boss. Manipulate the "House Edge" and foreclose on your enemies' souls.

### 🪄 Feats & Items
* **Brand of the Dead Man's Wager:** A supernatural gift/curse that grants immense defensive power before shifting into a grueling "Burden Phase."
* **Deadly Playing Cards:** Finesse/Thrown weapons for the discerning Cardsharp.
* **Unluck Eater:** A wondrous furball that eats your failed rolls and turns them into successes (for a hidden price).
* **Cheat Death & Card Shark:** Specialized feats for those living on the edge.
