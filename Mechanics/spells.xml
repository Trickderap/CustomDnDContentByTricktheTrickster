            <p>You flick a coin into the air, transforming it into a spinning, shimmering bolt of magical force. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the damage is dealt, the magical coin flips in the air (roll a d2 or flip a real coin):</p>
            <ul>

            <p class="indent">The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
