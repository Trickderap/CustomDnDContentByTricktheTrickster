            <p class="indent"><strong>Asset Seizure.</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and demand payment from a creature within 30 feet that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, one object the creature is holding (such as a weapon or arcane focus) flies from its grasp and into your open hand (or lands at your feet if your hands are full). If the object is magical, the creature takes force damage equal to your paladin level.</p>

            <p><em>"Your debt is due. Immediately."</em></p>
            <p>At 14th level, you can call in a debt with lethal force. As an action, you touch a creature. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes <strong>10d10 force damage</strong>. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
            <p>If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, you rip a fragment of their soul free, manifesting as a <strong>Soul Coin</strong>. You can consume this coin as a bonus action to regain one warlock spell slot.</p>

            <p><em>"Did you really think you could beat the Dealer?"</em></p>
            <p>At 20th level, you can channel the ultimate authority of the Proprietor. As an action, you can transform for 1 minute. While transformed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are immune to critical hits.</li>
                <li>When a creature you can see makes a d20 roll, you can use your reaction to treat the roll as a <strong>10</strong>. You can do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
                <li>You can cast <em>counterspell</em> or <em>dispel magic</em> at 5th level without expending a spell slot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
