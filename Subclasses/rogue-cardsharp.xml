            <p>At 3rd level, your Sneak Attack is infused with the magic of the suits. When you deal Sneak Attack damage with a playing card, roll a <strong>d4</strong> to determine a bonus effect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 (Hearts):</strong> Deal extra fire damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>2 (Clubs):</strong> The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + Prof + Cha) or be pushed 10 feet away.</li>
                <li><strong>3 (Diamonds):</strong> Deal extra force damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>4 (Spades):</strong> The target cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</li>
