            <p><em>"The odds are never in your favor."</em></p>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you learn to manipulate probability in your favor. When a creature within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to cancel the advantage. If you do so, you gain a <strong>House Chip</strong> (a d6). Within the next minute, you can roll this chip and add the number rolled to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.</p>
            <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p><em>"My best employees get... special protections."</em></p>
            <p>At 6th level, your patron ensures their assets are protected. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to swap places with a willing creature within 30 feet of you. If you have cast <em>hex</em> on a creature within 30 feet, you can swap places with them (unwillingly) instead. The creature you swapped with takes the hit.</p>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <p><em>"Your debt is due. Immediately."</em></p>
            <p>At 14th level, you can call in a debt with lethal force. As an action, you touch a creature. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes <strong>10d10 force damage</strong>. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
            <p>If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, you rip a fragment of their soul free, manifesting as a <strong>Soul Coin</strong>. You can consume this coin as a bonus action to regain one warlock spell slot.</p>

            <p>At 20th level, you can channel the ultimate authority of the Proprietor. As an action, you can transform for 1 minute. While transformed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are immune to critical hits.</li>
                <li>When a creature you can see makes a d20 roll, you can use your reaction to treat the roll as a <strong>10</strong>. You can do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
